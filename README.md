# HMS520_final_project
This is the repository for final group project of HMS520-Autumn2025 submitted by Zaw Wai Yan Bo and Pyone Yadanar Paing.

# Format of the analysis 
We will analyze National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R. 

# Overall goal of the project
The overall goal of this final project is to model mean systolic blood pressure (mmHg) by body mass index (kg/m2) among children who are 8 years old and above and adults in the United States by using NHANES (2021-2023) dataset. 

# Detailed plans and timelines
# 1: Download and load datasets
We will download three datasets necessary for this analyis from NHANES website: BMI, BP, Demographic files. 
Then we will merge those three datasets by respondent ID. 

# 2: Data Cleaning

# 3: Create necessary variables
We will create a mean SBP (mean_SBP) variable by taking average of three SBP measurements. 
We will also create a categorical age variable. 
We will model systolic blood pressure as dependent variable by body mass index as independent variable by age group.  

We will use data.table package, ggplot2 packages. 

# 4: Plotting 

# 5: Modelling
